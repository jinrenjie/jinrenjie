#  🙋 Hi there

Hi, I'm [George King](https://george.betterde.com/). A young Capricorn based in Shenzhen, China, specializing in back-end development. After graduating, I began my career in PHP and later transitioned to Golang thanks to a friend’s recommendation. Since then, I’ve explored a wide range of backend technologies, while also staying in touch with frontend development. As the saying goes, “Live and learn.” I genuinely enjoy coding and see programming as a form of art — I often describe myself as “swimming in the sea of code.”

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. i learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
